gzip-like CLI wrapper (for 7z)
==============================

The official site of the script p7zip provided in this directory
is http://packages.debian.org/unstable/utils/p7zip.


The script p7zip provides a CLI similar to that of
gzip/bzip2/etc Un*x utilities for 7z.

When necessary, it emulates streaming by using
temporary files in /tmp. This is all transparent to
the application using it, which can use the same
semantincs than with gzip or bzip2.

For example, you can do:

tar --use-compress-program=p7zip -cf file.tar.7z dir/

to generate a 7zipped tarball.
