7za/7z
======
- auto-generate config.h (use a configure script ...)

- suppress all exit(EXIT_FAILURE), FIXME, ...

- no chmod for TAR (should restore the rights set)

- no chown(uid,gid) for TAR

- Use a more portable "String.h"

- UTF16 : try to test with Complex Unicode filenames

- KNOWN BUGS

  - date (format arj/rar/chm) ?

- zip format : better support of symbolic links

7zG / 7zFM
==========================

- better help displaying

- better support for space in filenames


7zG :
 - sfx: wants 7z.sfx instead of 7zCon.sfx ?
 - the dialogs are not on top of other windows => not visible ...


7zFM :
 - the path "/" does not work (on OSX ?)
 - strange behaviour : selected/unselected items
