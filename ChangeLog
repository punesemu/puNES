  * 0x00
  * 0xFF (default)
  * Randomize.
- Added fully support to NES 2.0 file cart format header.
- Rewritten mappers : All.
- Added support to mapper : 100, 122, 157, 291, 311, 334, 362, 366, 384, 421, 446, 471, 551, 552, 561.

  Both files will be distributed together with the emulator and will be located in the following directories:
  * Linux/BSD - {default system datadir}/puNES
  * Windows - directory where the executable is placed.
  if you want to use a more updated version than the one distributed with the emulator, just copy it either in the executable directory or in the working directory of the emulator, which can also be opened from the "File -> Open working directory" menu.
- Rewritten WRAM, VRAM, PRGROM, CHROM and Nametebles management.
- Rewritten the format and management of save states.
  WARNING save states of version 0.110 or earlier are no longer compatible.

Note: Due to the numerous changes I'm making to the core of the emulator, new bugs may have been introduced, if you find roms no longer work correctly compared to the previous version, please let me know.

0.110
- Added support to Wayland.
- Added support for "Fullscreen in window" with Wayland (the only type of fullscreen supported for now).
- Added iNES/NES 2.0 header editor.
- Added support for "Family Basic Keyboard" and "Subor Keyboard".
  * It's possible to capture and release keyboard input with the shortcut "Scrollock" and open and
    close a virtual keyboard with "CTRL+X".
  * Implemented the "Paste" function. It's possible to paste the text by dragging it in the main
    window of the emulator or copying it and then press the right mouse button and selecting "Paste".
    The text will be inserted through the simulation of the pressure of the keys and it will always
    be possible to interrupt the insertion by pressing the ESC key. During the paste, the Fast Forwarding
    will be active to reduce the waiting time.
  * Added support for the tape data recorder. Added a "Tape" submenu in the "NES" menu, also the same
    menu is present in the context menu of the main window (right click) when the Keyboard is in use.
    By default I use my own format for tape images but you can also save and load tape images
    in Virtuanes and Nestopia format.
- Added a shortcut "M" to simulate a shout in the microphone of the second controller.
- Renamed "Fast Forward" shortcut to "Toggle Fast Forward" and added a new "Fast Forward (hold button)" shortcut.
- Added a Wizard to select the operating mode (portable mode or not) the first time the emulator is run.
  (Info for those who already used the emulator) To run in portable mode there are 3 distinct ways:
  * If the executable is in a folder containing the puNES.cfg file.
  * Rename the executable by adding the suffix _p.
    (Examples: punes.exe -> punes_p.exe or punes64.exe -> punes64_p.exe)
  * Run the emulator with the "--portable" option.
- Support for XDG Base Directory Specification.
  On UNIX-Like operating systems the configuration files will be found in "$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/puNES" and the rest
  in "$XDG_DATA_HOME/puNES". Also under Windows the location of the working directory has changed and will now
  be located in "C:\Users\<USER>\AppData\Local\puNES". Regarding the portable mode nothing has changed, everything
  will be placed in the directory containing the executable. When the emulator is started, the old directories
  will be automatically moved to the new location. In order to open the configuration directory easily, it's always
  possible to do so via the menu items "File->Open working directory" [Windows and UNIX-Like] or
  "File->Open config directory" [UNIX-Like].
- Added a cmake option to disable portable mode handling (useful in sandbox environments like Flatpak).
- Added French translation (thx to Benjamin Siskoo).
- Added German translation (thx to JacobDev).
- Updated Chinese Simplified, Hungarian, Italian, Portuguese and Russian translation (thx to owomomo, shinyoyo,
  TCH, Matheus Scattolin Anselmo and Alexey Timonin).
  It was not possible to update the Spanish and Turkish one because I lost contact with MS-PC and Ömercan Kömür.
- Updated internal shaders.
- Improved FDS sound emulation.
- Fixed autoswitch timing for FDS.
- Fixed decimal mode support.

- Fixed UNIF mapper : CITYFIGHT, FS-304
- Added video filters: 2xSaI,  Dot Matrix, PAL TV1x, PAL TV2x, PAL TV3x, PAL TV4x, Super 2xSaI, Super Eagle,
  TV2x, TV3x, TV4x.
- Added video filters: NTSC Bisqwit 2X, NTSC Bisqwit 4X, NTSC Bisqwit 8X (https://forums.nesdev.org/viewtopic.php?t=14338).
  Notice : This filter uses its own color palette.
- Migrated the project from autotools to cmake.
- Added AppStream manifest.
- Fixed high dpi support.

- Redesigned the Standard Controller configuration dialog.
- Added support for FFmpeg 5.1 libraries.
- Fixed many many many other bugs.

0.109 (Bug fixes release)
- Fixed 'make install'.
- Added support for mapper 210 and improved support for Nes 2.0 format.
- Disabled creation of mimeinfo.cache with 'make install' (https://github.com/punesemu/puNES/issues/191).
- With some DE if I don't reset the min and max size of the window with reset_min_max_size(),
  the fullscreen is wrecked (https://github.com/punesemu/puNES/issues/186).
- Improved high dpi support.
  * Rewrote part of the overlay.
  * Uniform font used in the overlay.
  * Uniform graphics management between OpenGL and D3D9.
- Fixed the shaders "NTSC 2Phase Composite" and "Old TV" in D3D9 version (https://github.com/punesemu/puNES/issues/188).
- Sometimes the mouse cursor may not be visible. Fixed.
- Entering or leaving the fullscreen could cause the window to lose focus. Fixed.

0.108
- Updated translation from Crowdin (thx to Алексей Тимонин, MS-PC, tch_oscomp, Ömercan Kömür, Matheus).
- Added Chinese translation (thx to owomomo).
- Added an option to show frames and lags counters.
- Rewritten the audio of the VRC7.
  Implemented the project "Cycle-accurate emulation of Yamaha OPLL" of Nuke.YKT :
  * https://github.com/nukeykt/Nuked-OPLL
  Many thx to Nuke.YKT for his wonderful work.
- Updated the icon and the banner of the info page.
  * a big thank you to the papirus icon theme guys for letting me use
    their icon (https://github.com/PapirusDevelopmentTeam/papirus-icon-theme)
  * thanks also to the unknown author of the banner who, unfortunately, I
    was unable to identify.
- Increased compatibility with OpenGL shaders.
  Fixed many bugs and crashes that prevented some OpenGL shaders
  (https://github.com/libretro/glsl-shaders) from loading and functioning correctly.
- Implemented the ability to select the resolution of the fulscreen.
- Added the option to automatically set the refresh rate based on the
  region of the rom used (50/100Hz for PAL/Dendy roms, 60/120Hz for NTSC)
  if the monitor supports them. The rewriting of the fullscreen management
  allowed to correct some bugs present for a long time (for example under
  Linux/BSD the fullscreen window did not always identify the real screen
  size available because it did not take into account the various task
  bars and menu bars).
- Fixed initial positioning of the emulator window.
  If, in a multi-monitor environment, the window is positioned on a
  display that is no longer connected upon restart, the position may no
  longer be valid and the emulator window may not be visible.
- Implemented the ability to view the menu bar in fullscreen mode
  through a configurable shortcut (default is ALT+M).
- Implemented the double click management on the menu bar:
  * left button hides toolbar and statusbar
  * right button hides the whole gui (as when using the shortcut ALT+G "Toggle GUI in window").
- Now it's possible to use the ESC as a shortcut.
- The code is now QT6 compatible.
- Added the ability to customize NTSC filters in video settings.
- Fixed the aspect ratio of the NTSC filters in fullscreen mode.
- Updated to FFmpeg 4.4.
- Fixed video recording in HENC format at high quality.
- Added support for the Opus audio format in audio recording.
- Added an option to change CPU/PPU alignment at power-up/hard reset.
- Added this 3 options for the Famicom Disk System
  * "Insert disk 1 side A at power-up/reset"
  * "Switch the disk/side automatically"
  * "Use fast forward when loading the BIOS or disk/side"
  in the "Settings->General". They are activated by default and do what is written in the description.
- Now, by default, only one instance of the emulator is allowed to run.
  To allow the execution of more instances it is necessary to enable the
  new option in "Settings->General".
- Added the management of the double click when selecting a rom from a compressed archive.
  I honestly don't know why I haven't already implemented it.
- Fixed inversion of controller mode NES/Four Score.
- Added the cmd line option "--hidden-gui" to start the emulator with
  hidden GUI (useful for frontends) and that it's also possible to do with
  the shortcut ALT+G.
- Rewritten overlay and widget for save slot selection and increased the number of slots to 12.
- Added an option to re-enable the sprite limit when a game needs it (https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Sprite_overflow_games).
- Added support for subtitles of TAS videos. They will appear in the info bar with center alignment.
- Rewritten the cheat editor to make it easier and more manageable.
- Added sample rates of 96000 and 192000 and improved the selection of the
  sample rate of audio codecs that don't provide information about those supported.
- Rewritten the input management through gamepads and joysticks.
  * Added multithreading management.
  * In the Linux version added the dependency to libudev.
  * Increased the emulation speed by 7-10%.
  * Eliminated (especially in the windows version) blocks and slowdowns
    of the emulation in the case of gamepads configured but not connected to
    the start of the emulator.
  * Uniformed the management of inputs on all the various ports.
  * Separeted joystick/gamepads configuration from the port configuration,
    now each gamepads will have its own configuration.
  * Added an option to set the deadzone
  * Added a new tool: "Joypad/Gamepad Debug". With this you can see the info
    on the connected devices, it is also possible to disable the reading of
    certain axes and buttons from the gamepad status reading routine. In addition
    to debugging reasons, it is an option to be able to use gamepads that send
    incorrect values on some axis or button while still allowing their use.
  * Added automatic recognition of the type of gamepad with relative
    configuration. Supported for now Steam Controller (only under Linux), 
    Xbox 360 Controller and Playstation 3 (thx to Gianmarco Trentadue for for the donation) and 4
    controllers which are the ones I had at my disposal. It should also work with Xbox One controllers but
    I couldn't check it as I didn't have any.
  * NOTICE : All buttons bindings will need to be reconfigured.
- Fixed many many many other bugs.

0.107
- Updated translation from Crowdin (thx to Алексей Тимонин, MS-PC, tch_oscomp, Ömercan Kömür, Matheus).
- Redesigned settings GUI.
- Added an option to flip the screen horizontally (even when rotated).
- Added an option to make the input (keyboard and controller) "follow" the orientation of the screen.
  Try to replay your favorite games in this mode, you will find it fun. (Thx to eugene-s-nesdev for the idea).
- Added "AxelayNES" Demo to the database.
- Added spanish traslation of Ganbare Goemon Gaiden 2 to the database.
- Added an option to reverse bits of DPCM (also in the NSF player).
  To understand what "reverse" is for, take a look at this post http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=20308.
- Added the preview of the last screen image of the saved states.
  Now it is always possible view the screen of the saved states when you move the mouse between the various
  Slots in the "State" menu (slots with the available preview will be marked with a "*"). It's also available in the
  combobox of the toolbar widget.The preview will be displayed as a tooltip.
- Added, thanks to the FFMPEG libraries, the ability to create video and audio files of the game session.
  The supported video formats are:
  * MPEG 1 Video
  * MPEG 2 Video
  * MPEG 4 Video
  * MPEG H264 Video
  * High Efficiency Video Codec
  * WebM Video
  * Windows Media Video
  * AVI FF Video
  * AVI Video
  The supported audio formats are:
  * WAV Audio
  * MP3 Audio
  * AAC Audio
  * Flac Audio
  * Ogg Audio
  The parameters relating to the recording are available in the configuration GUI.
  It's possible to start a recording through the keyboard shortcuts (CTRL+A for audio and CTRL+V for video)
  also from the widget located at the bottom right of the statusbar. Clicking on it with the left mouse button will
  start the last type of registration, with the right button a context menu where you can select what to start.
  Once the recording has started, you can stop it either with the same shortcuts with which it was started or by
  clicking on the statusbar widget.
  The emulator will always remember the last used settings.
- Added "Raw" palette. To understand what this palette is, I use the explanation found on
  Emulation General Wiki https://emulation.gametechwiki.com/index.php/Famicom_Color_Palette :
  "option to output the raw chroma, level, and emphasis from the PPU through the RGB color channels.
  This by itself produces an image with completely bizarre colors, but this can be decoded by shaders
  to generate actual colors, the main examples being GTU-Famicom and nes-color-decoder".
  So it's usable with all shaders that support it:
  cgwg-famicom-geom.glsl, gtu-famicom.glsl or ntsc-nes.glsl that you find  in the
  libretro glsl-shaders repository https://github.com/libretro/glsl-shaders.
  P.s. this works with OpenGL version.
- Fixed compatibility with GLSL shaders (like MMJ_Cel_Shader.glslp or all crt-royale.glslp series).
  You can find this shader at glsl-shaders https://github.com/libretro/glsl-shaders and
  common-shaders https://github.com/libretro/common-shaders.
- Fixed VRC7 sound pitch.
- Fixed saving of window position in a multi-monitor setup (thx to baraclese for the patch).
- Fixed the restoration of the hidden state of the toolbar widgets.
- NSF/NSFe player. Added a new effect and revised the "bars" effect. It's now possible to move between the
  various effects using the up and down of the pad or by clicking on the right or left side of the effect viewer.
  Changed the help text explaining the pad commands.
- Redesigned the command line help display.
- On a computer where the amulator had never been started, at the first run it was started in the top left but
  hiding the window frame preventing it from moving or closing. Fixed.
- Now the settings window is resizable.
- Fixed several bugs in the Cheat Editor and in the Input Settings.
  Cheat Editor:
  * Fixed a possible crash that occurs when entering a new cheat.
  * Fixed several table display errors.
  * Active cheats are now easily identifiable thanks to a different color.
  * Fixed a bug that did not activate the selected cheat correctly.
  * Cheat description tooltip.
  Input settings:
  * Minor cosmetic changes.
- Fixed many many many other bugs.

- Fixed graphical problem with xBRZ filter.
- Fixed mappers 50, 90, 156, 178, UNL-KOF97, UNL-VRC7, MMC3 KT-008 PCB.
- Fixed possible issue with High DPI monitor.

- Updated the Russian translation (thx Alter0ne).
- Fixed the disappearance of the mouse cursor after two seconds.
- Fixed the emulator freezing if pressed "Switch Sides" hotkey.
- Added the rewind function that replaces the timeline.
  Now it is possible to "rewind" the game. Once the rewind function has
  been activated (at any time during the game) it is possible to move
  forward and backward in the gameplay one frame at a time or at different
  speeds (1x, 2x, 4x, 8x, 16x, 32x or 64x). You will be able to move
  freely in the recording until you press the "play" button, from that
  moment all the gameplay memorized after the selected frame will be lost.
  In the "general settings" you can select the duration in minutes of the
  recordable gameplay (the different options are: disable, 2mins, 5mins,
  15mins, 30min, 60mins or unlimited) but keep in mind that the more
  minutes you can record the more space on the hard disk will be used.

0.103
- Added support for the UNIF mapper UNIF DREAMTECH01.
- Fixed mapper MMC5 and 213.
- Added support for NSFe format.
- Added OpenBSD support.
- Added support for IPS, BPS and XDELTA patches.
  It's possible to patch the ROM through 3 ways:
  1) rename the patch with the same name as the ROM and copy it to the same directory where the ROM is present (example: if "Adventures of Lolo (U) [!].nes" is the name of the ROM, rename the patch in "Adventures of Lolo (U) [!].ips")
  2) drag it to the emulator window (compressed patches are supported)
  3) apply it via the "Apply Patch" item in the File menu (compressed patches are supported)
  If more than one patch is present in the compressed file, it will always be possible to select which one to apply. In order to automatically apply a patch to a ROM, in addition to method 1) it is also possible to create a compressed archive that contains both the ROM and the patch. In this case the name of the ips file isn't important (example : compressed file contain "Adventures of Lolo (U) [!].nes" and "adv.ips").
- Rewritten the UI for the settings.
- Added the compatibility of the UI for High DPI.
- Rewritten and uniformed GFX stack.
- Increased performance by 20%/30%.

- Added the ability to change shader parameters if supported by the shader.
- Added a palette editor.
- Added in Video Settings an option to show FPS.
- Eliminated a lot of unnecessary code.

0.98 (Bugfix release)
- Windows: fixed a bug (introduced in the rewriting of the audio subsystem of version 0.97) that did not allow the correct synchronization between threads distorting the sound after a few minutes of use.
- fixed a typo in the config file configuration for the "panning" option.
- converted to autotools build system.
- from now puNES is an open-source project (https://github.com/punesemu/puNES). Among the links now there will always be the source tarball of the latest release. I will continue to release binaries for Linux versions even though I do not think will serve much longer. At compile time, you can specify whether you want to use the QT5 instead of QT4 passing the "--enable-qt5" to configure.

0.97
- rewritten the audio stack to eliminate problems of lags and crackling.
- added in the audio settings new option "Buffer Size factor". To a lower value corresponds to a smaller size buffer (less lag but most possible crackles on slower computers). The larger the buffer, the greater the lag but less chance of crackles.

- Fixed the issue with Startropics e Startropics II.

0.91 (Major release)
- Completely rewritten GUI doing a complete porting to QT. Although user level this leads to a few visual changes, at the level of code management and development time has changed the world. Now I have to maintain a single codebase for all versions drastically reducing the time of development and maintaining a uniform GUI on both platforms. Add new functions is now much easier and faster.

- Added the ability to save and load save states directly from the file.
- Now the shortcuts are reconfigurable (although for now only by editing input.cfg).
- Added the ability to translate the GUI (for now only English and Italian but if someone wants help...).
- Fixed a lot of bugs and optimized the code making this version the faster and more precise than ever.
Although tested on multiple computers (I thank all those who gave me a hand in recent months with testing and suggestions and especially Eugene.S, angrylion and Oldghost) it is possible that there are still bugs. Thanks in advance everyone who will report them to me.

P.s. I recommend you to delete files "puNES.cfg" and "input.cfg" before launching this version.

0.89 (Bugfix release)
In some circumstances, the audio could not be played correctly (crackling and pops). Fixed

0.88
Added the possibility to save and load the color palette to/from file. The file format is the same used by FCEUX:
"Palette files are expected to Contain 64 8-bit RGB triplets (each in that order, red comes first in the triplet in the file, then green, then blue).".
To experiment take a look at this post http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=21&t=11281

0.87 (Massive bugfix release)
Fixed all the bugs that did not allow the proper functioning of many gamepads. Are now properly recognized all those tested (XBOX 360 controller, DualShock 2, DualShock 3, DualShock 4, Twin USB Joystick and many other [Thx to Kirkor and to the other "volunteers"]). Linux and Windows versions.

Fixed all the bugs with the mapper 31 (2A03 Puritans works well now).

0.85
I continued to work hard on the synchronization between CPU/PPU and CPU/APU to make it more accurate. Now "Micro Machines (Camerica) [!]. nes" works without any graphical glitches also "Huge Insect (Sachen) [!].nes" finally works perfectly (http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=465). Considering that the changes affecting the core of the emulator, I have tested many roms (tests and games) and it seems that everything is running smoothly, but if someone were to find some roms that gives problems with this release, please contact me. Thanks to x0000 for the help on the front of the CPU/APU.
Fixed some bugs in the handling of compressed files with the game genie active (thx Chad).

0.84

With the overscan active not passed the correct size of the virtual screen to the shader and this involved distortions (see, for example, the filter "CRT" with overscan active in the old version). Fixed.
Fixed a bug in the management of the IRQ of the FDS and now "Kaettekita Mario Bros. (1988) (Nintendo) (J). Fds" is fully playable.
D3D9:
Fixed a serious bug that did not pass the correct size of the window of the emulator to the shader, producing undesirable results (such as, for example, with the scanlines filter).

0.81
Added option "TV Aspect Ratio" in the video settings that simulates the screen format of the old televisions (4:3).
Added option "Interpolation" which enables, regardless of the type of filter used, the bilinear interpolation of the image.
Set to "1" the default value for the delay of the turbo buttons.
Fixed a memory leak in version D3D9.

0.80
Completed porting to DirectX. Both versions are now available for windows (SDL and D3D). I tried to share as much code as possible in order to make maintenance easier and this has led me to heavy internal changes so if someone finds some roms that worked with the previous version, can contact me. In addition, this revision work has brought to light many existing bugs that have been fixed (maybe replaced by others) for all versions (Linux and Windows). I stopped to make a list of all fixes some time ago so I can only advise you to download it, you will find it more stable and more efficient. A big thank you to all those who gave me a hand in the beta testing phase (Eugene.s, Kirkor, OldGhost, kaz321123, sedusg, Darkness Knight, mangamuscle and the other guys).

0.79 (Bugfix release)
In the Windows version, the implementation of the openbus in the reading of reg $4016 and $4017 I had introduced a bug that did not allow the correct reading of the pressure of the turbo buttons. Correct. (thx qinvhi)
Always in the Windows version removed the input lag when using joysticks and gamepads. (thx kaz321123)
Fixed a bug that did not allow for the proper handling of compressed archives with more than 100 roms.
In preparation of the implementation of the header NES 2.0 I cleaned and reorganized the code of mappers. If someone were to find roms that worked with the previous version but not with this please contact me.

0.78
Implemented mappers 28, 42, 91, 105, 153.
Implemented the openbus on the read from $4016 and $4017 (for improved accuracy).
Improved handling of IRQ in the mapper 64 ("Hard Drivin.nes" now works correctly).
Linux version:
I've forgotten to implement the scrollbar in the window of uncompress roms (that only appears when there are more roms in the same archive). Fixed.
Now the minimum version of supported gtk2 is 2.18, so the emulator can also run on older distributions (eg Ubuntu 10.10 or Linux Mint 9).
Windows version:
Fixed a bug in the management of the turbo buttons that did not allow proper operation.

0.77 (Bugfix release)
In compressed files were not handled correctly the long names of files. Fixed.
In some circumstances, in the Win64 version, there might be an error loading the necessary dll. Fixed.
Also in the windows version, it could happen that the list of files in the open rom dialog (Ctrl + O) was not updated when changing the filter. Fixed.
(thanks to mangamuscle for all reports)

0.76
Added support for compressed archives.
For the windows version is required the "7z.dll" (already included in the installation's zip).
For the linux version is necessary that the package p7zip is installed in the system.
Compressed archives supported : 7z, ZIP and RAR (in the linux version only if p7zip is istalled with RAR extension).
If 7zip/p7zip library are not found, are managed natively just zip archives.

0.75
Implemented mappers 83, 90, 163, 164, 209, 211, 249.

0.74
Rewrite the GUI for the input configuration that now are more user friendly (at least for me). I've eliminated the check on the conflicts and if you want (for some reason) use the same keyboard/joystick configuration for all players, now you can (for me it was very useful to do so). Adde an option to permit "Up+Down" and "Left+Right".
Added the support for 4 players (Famicom and Four Score).
I forgot to add support for the roms with the trainer. Done. Now even the rom "Dragon Ball - Shen Long no Nazo (J) [hM34] [T + Eng1.11_TransBRC]" works.

0.70
Fixed some memory leaks (thanks to Valgrind).
A restriction in the code of mapper UnROM prevented the start of the "Battle Kids 2 - Mountain of Torment". Fixed.
*** Windows Version ***
In this version I've rewritten from scratch the Audio stack. I abandoned the use of SDL replaced with the XAudio2 (DirectX). With this I hope I have permanently removed the audio lag problem experienced by many.
Improved handling of reading from gamepads, now the sensitivity and accuracy are significantly better. Increased compatibility with many gamepad (thanks OldGhost).
Fixed a bug which allowed the start of the screensaver during the game session.

0.69

Fixed a bug introduced in a previous version that did not allow the start of the "Batman - Return of the Joker".
Added support for Windows 8.
Added CLI option "--portable" for run puNES in portable mode (is no longer necessary to rename the executable even if it is still possible to do so for backwards compatibility).
Fixed the display of the parameters of the command line in the Windows version.

0.68 (bugfix release)
Correct a bug introduced in version 0.66 that in some circumstances, did not allow the filling of the audio buffer in time, producing a sound skipping.

0.67
Correct the support for the D-pad in the Windows version (reported by Alterac).
In the "Standard Pad" setup added a button (1 for Keyboard and 1 for Joystick) to unbind all buttons (suggested by Alterac).
Implemented the support of Drag & Drop of roms directly in the emulator window to load them (suggested by thefox).
Other small bugfixes.

0.66
Fixed some little bugs in the apu engine (sweep and triangle) and implemented the non-linearity and interaction between audio channels. Now (finally) the apu_mixer (http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Emulator_tests) test roms works well in puNES (I hope).

0.65 (bugfix relase)
Fixed a small bug introduced in version 0.64.
Adjusted slightly to stereo mode

0.64
Rewrite from scratch the audio subsytem and now there are two new options in the "Audio" menu, "Low" and "High" quality.
"Low" is the old engine, "High" is the new engine. Just try to hear the difference.
Fixed many bugs in APU emulation which is now much more accurate.
Added the ability to have a portable version of the emulator. Just rename the executable:
Linux:
punes32 -> punes32_p
punes64 -> punes64_p
Windows
punes32.exe -> punes32_p.exe
punes64.exe -> punes64_p.exe

Added "Overscan" option in the video menu that reduce the visible scanline from 240 to 224 by cutting the first and the last 8 scanlines. This setting is specific for the rom in use. If you change it, will be remembered when you open them again. If you set to "Default", puNES will always use the setting checked in "Default value" menu.

0.41 (bugfix release)
In the previous release I have fixed many bugs but it is also true that others have been added, such as an annoying disturbance of sound that, under certain circumstances, could afflict the windows version. Fixed.

0.33
Implemented MMC5 mapper (5).

0.32 (bugfix release)
correct another bug in the save system. I have tested many roms and now everything (hopefully) works perfectly. Delete (for the last time [hopefully]) the directory "save" located in the folder "$HOME/.puNES" on linux or "$Documents$/puNES" on Windows.

0.31
for a bug in the save system, the file created on a 32bit machine was different from the one created on a 64bit and one created on a Linux system they could not be used on a Windows system. The error has been corrected but the saves already made are no longer usable. Delete the directory "save" located in the folder "$HOME/.puNES" on linux or "$Documents$/puNES" on Windows. To make better use of the combobox, the used slots will have a black text while the empty ones will have gray text, also passing the mouse over the used slots, will be automatically displayed a screenshot captured at the time of the save. For every laoded rom will always be remembered the last used slot.
In the Windows version I'have redesigned the toolbar.

0.30
added a save/load state system with 6 slots.
F1 = save state
F2 = dec slot
F3 = inc slot
F4 = load state

0.29 (bugfix release)
correct some bugs and redesigned the timeline in the windows version.
In the linux version i dropped the dependency with some libraries (such as the libpng 1.4) and this should make the emulator also run correctly on distributions like Ubuntu.

0.28
in this release I have implemented a "Timeline" bar. In the lower left corner there is now a bar with which you can go "back in time" up to a maximum of 60 seconds. Each tick corresponds to 5 seconds. If you don't want to use the mouse you can also use the keyboard. Pressing CTRL will pause the emulator and, while keeping CTRL pressed, you can move the bar with the left and right buttons.

0.27
I had forgotten to enable the save of configuration, fixed.
I built an internal database to automatically recognize the rom type (PAL or NTSC). If the Mode is setting to "Auto", the emulator will try to recognize the rom otherwise it will use the preferred mode.

0.26
Added native GUI for Linux (GTK+2) and for Windows.
Implemented Taito mapper (33).

0.25
Implemented Hard Reset (F11 key) and Soft Reset (F12 key).
Implemented switch from PAL system and NTSC with F8 Key.
Implemented PPU Open Bus and correct some bugs in DMC emulation.
Implemented AxROM, BxROM, GxROM and CPROM mappers.
I finally manage to pass all the Blargg's tests that I've found on the internet (including sprdma_and_dmc_dma.nes and sprdma_and_dmc_dma_512.nes).

0.24
Implemented emulation of mappers MMC2, MMC4, ColorDreams and Camerica.
Correct a little bug and now "Time Lord (U) [!].nes" work without glitches.

0.23
Implemented the save on file for the PRG Ram battery packed.
Rewrite MMC1 emulation and tested with all GoodNES MMC1 roms.
Now work without glitches the MMC3 chinese roms that in the previous version had problems (Aladdin 2 (Unl), Bing Kuang Ji Dan Zi - Flighty Chicken (Ch), Chu Han Zheng Ba - The War Between Chu & Han (Ch) an many others).

0.22
Implemented all illegal opcode.
Rewrite from scratch MMC3 emulation and now really work with every rom that I've tested (for two weeks I've tryed all 5118 MMC3 GoodNES roms including Blargg mmc3 test) except for few bootleg and some chinese roms (why??).
Implemented fix for young indiana jones chronicles (thx James).

0.21
Correct some bugs in the MMC3 (NTSC and PAL) and now
all the roms that I'have tried works well.

0.20
Implemented illegal opcode 0x80 for the "Beauty and the Beast (E) [!].nes" rom

0.19
complete APU emulation.
This is my first attempt with sdl sound and perhaps there may be some bugs. For now, without the implementation of frameskip, the emulator has to work 100% for not having problems with sound skip and crackle.
Changed the structure of the code and now the emu takes less than 100Kb.
Correct many many many bugs.

0.18:
added AxROM (mapper 7) emulation.

0.17:
fixed another bug and now Incredible Crash Dummies run without problems.

0.16:
correct a couple of bugs in the mmc3 emulation.

0.15:
added MMC3 emulation.

0.14:
Correct a a bug in the controller routine (thanks Dwedit).

0.13:
Correct a little bug and now all cpu_interrupts_v2 test roms passed.

0.12:
Implemented reading of $2004 during the rendering.
(thx to Quietust for the info and for the read2004.nes test rom).

0.11:
I worked hard on the CPU and PPU emulation and now many
of test roms worked perfectly (thanks blargg).
Added OpenGL support.
Implemented APU Frame Interrupt (only this for now).
Many bugs are gone.
